# Cloud-Type-Identifier
This is an app which utilizes a classification model to determine the type of cloud based on a photo.

This is just a side project because I always wonder which types of clouds are in the sky.

The plan is to create a dataset by scraping cloud images under a query for a specific type, then labelling them with that query.

Then, I'm going to try to train a CNN classification model on the images.
