# Cloud Type Classifier
This was *meant* to be made into an app which could classify the type of clouds by taking a picture on your phone.

However, there's very little data on cloud types, so the only way I could think to make a dataset was to webscrape images with a query for each type of cloud.

Unfortunately, it didn't end up working very well because the data is pretty poor quality and there tends to be a lot of co-mingleing of types within each query

There's probably a way to use unsupervised learning, but there's still a lot of challenges to face there, so I decided to put this one on the backburner for now.
